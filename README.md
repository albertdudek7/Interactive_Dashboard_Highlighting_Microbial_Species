# Interactive Dashboard displaying Belly Button Biodiversity dataset

Built an interactive dashboard to visualize and explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset that catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 

Findings: This dataset reveals that a small number of microbial specias (or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. 

Using the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.
